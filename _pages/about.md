Welcome! I am a mathematical physicist working in the area of Quantum Field Theory, General Relativity and Quantum Gravity. I have just started my postdoc at [MPIM Bonn](https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de). Previously, I was [Riemann fellow](https://www.rc.uni-hannover.de/en/) in the group of [Prof Giulini](https://www.itp.uni-hannover.de/de/ag/giulini/). Last year, I finished my doctoral studies at [HU Berlin](https://www2.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~maphy/) in the group of [Prof Kreimer](https://www2.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~kreimer/). 


## Research insterests

### Topics I have worked on:
* Renormalization in Quantum Field Theory
* Quantization of gauge theories and gravity
* Mathematical Relativity
* Structure of asymptotically flat spacetimes

### Topics I am keen to learn:
* Algebraic Quantum Field Theory
* BV formalism
* Deformation quantization
* Noncommutative geometry
