A seminar about different topics in mathematicsl physics, broadly around Quantum Field Theory and Homological Algebra. Our meetings are hosted by an assigned speaker, who gives an informal introduction to his topic. Alongside, we will have questions from the audience, which typically lead to a lively discussion.

[Official MPIM seminar webpage](https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/12745), [my webpage](https://davidprinz.org/seminar/) might be more up to date though.

We meet almost every Thursday (see dates below) at 11:30 am in the [MPIM seminar room](https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/4234).

## Topics

We have decided on the following three topics, with some additional buzzwords:

### Supersymmetric Quantum Field Theories:
* Supergeometry
* Atiyah--Singer theorem
* Morse theory

### Conformal Field Theories:
* Representation theory
* Kac--Moody and vertex algebras
* Line bundles
* Loop groups
* Conformal blocks

### (Perturbative) Chern--Simons Theory:
* BV formalism
* Knot theory
* Kontsevich integral (with link to supersymmetry)
