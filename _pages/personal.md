I am always very curious in the personalities behind the professional curtain. Thus, this page is intended to offer a little glimpse into my hobbies and interests beside math.

First of all, I am very much into [music](/music). This includes playing the piano, but also listening to music or going to concerts. I am very open to different music styles, but I do especially vibe with modern jazz.

Furthermore, I enjoy various sports, especially outdoors in nature. In particular, I like beachvolleyball, climbing, mountainbiking, skiing, surfing and tennis.

In addition, besides school and studies, I did the following (volunteering) work:
* Youth leader at [German Alpine Club](https://www.alpenverein.de) (overseeing a weekly climbing group & planning outdoor trips)
* Working as a skiing instructor at [PTSV Konstanz](http://dsv-skischule-konstanz.de)
* Working in a bicycle shop at [Rad Center Paradies](https://regiostars.suedkurier.de/Profil/RAD-CENTER_Paradies_GBR_57091)
